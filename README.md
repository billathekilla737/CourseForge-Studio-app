# CourseForge Studio

One local web app for Canvas instructors. It grades, it makes courses
accessible, it builds content, and it runs the chores around a course, all from
one page on your own computer, using the Claude Code login you already have.

It grew out of two tools by the same author: **canvas-grader** (the review UI
and the safety model) and **CourseForge** (the ADA remediation toolkit, the
PDF/UA engine, the content builder, the Assistant). Both are superseded by this
repository. See [docs/MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md) for what moved where.

## What it does

Open a course and you get six areas. Use any of them alone.

| Area | What it is for |
|---|---|
| **Grade** | Pulls an assignment's rubric and submissions, drafts a rubric-aligned grade and a two-sentence comment for every student with Claude, and gives you a side-by-side review before a single point reaches Canvas. Insights, curves, overlap check, a teaching read, quiz settings and accommodations, the term schedule. The manual is [docs/GRADING.md](docs/GRADING.md). |
| **Accessibility** | Brings an existing course up to ADA / Ally: restyles every page, assignment, discussion, quiz description and the syllabus with a gate that proves the visible text did not change, then pushes in place. Fixes PowerPoint and Word files (alt text, slide titles, header rows). Fixes PDFs with a PDF/UA-1 engine (OCR layer, tag tree, title and language, fonts) validated with veraPDF, describes figures with Claude, and uploads over the originals so links keep working. Edits text inside PDFs and Office files (a former instructor's name in every handout). Two jobs, named as such on the tab row: **Fix accessibility** (Pages, PowerPoint, Word, PDFs) makes a file usable by a screen reader; **Find and replace** (in PDFs, in Office files) changes the words inside one and has nothing to do with accessibility. |
| **Build** | Drafts a page, syllabus, assignment, graded discussion, quiz or study guide in the school's Canvas-safe template, checks it against the style rules, and places it in the module you choose, unpublished by default. Project manifests for whole modules. Rubrics. |
| **Tools** | Export a course to `.imscc`, import a cartridge, copy a course into a sandbox. Roll due dates to a new term from the academic calendar with a week-by-week table to approve. Trim the left navigation. Back up a quiz before rewriting it. Cross-reference the course against the state learning outcomes for its program. |
| **Assistant** | A Claude Code session for the course, in the browser. Say what you want in plain English. Ask about a student by name and it answers from what the Studio has graded on this machine, by tag, without a name ever leaving it. It drives the same verbs as the buttons, and every time it wants to change Canvas a card appears asking you to Allow or Deny. No answer means no. |
| **Reports** | Two things you show somebody else. An accessibility score with a before and an after, measured from the originals kept on this machine, so "this course went from 35 to 100" is a sentence you can say to a dean. And every syllabus checked against the statements your college requires -- ADA, academic integrity, attendance, Title IX -- as one table. Neither writes anything. |
| **Record** | Every change the Studio made in the course, written down as it happened: what, when, on whose account, and for which student where a student is the point. Each entry carries the fingerprint of the one before it, so an edit after the fact shows up. Kept in your own Canvas files as well as on the PC. The manual is [docs/RECORD.md](docs/RECORD.md). |

Three rules hold everywhere:

- **Nothing reaches Canvas on one click.** Every write is refused once by the
  server, shown to you as a plain sentence, and sent only when you confirm that
  exact change. Dry run first, always.
- **The tool proves before it pushes.** Restyled HTML must pass a visible-text
  comparison; fixed PDFs must survive an independent text and render check or
  they are deleted and queued for a person; documents that fail verification
  are never uploaded.
- **Student data stays on this machine.** Type a real name anywhere a model
  is involved and it is swapped for a tag first -- `S-001` while grading,
  `Student-1` in the Assistant -- and swapped back on the way to your screen.
  The list of who is who never leaves your computer. Every area except grading
  works through a Canvas client that cannot reach submissions, grades or
  rosters at all. Type `@` in the Assistant for the roster, so the spelling is
  never yours to get wrong, and a name typed a keystroke off is stopped and
  queried rather than sent as written. The details, and the one thing this
  does not cover, are in [docs/NAMES.md](docs/NAMES.md).
- **What it did is written down.** Every Canvas write goes into a chained,
  tamper-evident record kept in your own Canvas files, with accommodations and
  grades named by student. See [docs/RECORD.md](docs/RECORD.md).

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10+** (3.12 recommended)
- **Claude Code CLI**, installed and signed in: <https://claude.com/claude-code>
- A **Canvas API token** for your own account (the setup screen walks you through it)
- Optional, for the PDF fixer's OCR and compliance proof: **Tesseract**, **veraPDF** and a **Java** runtime.
  The first launch offers to install all three. Tesseract and Java come from
  winget; veraPDF has no package anywhere, so the Studio fetches the project's
  own installer, checks it against a known hash and runs it unattended into
  your user folder, where no administrator rights are needed. You can decline:
  everything else works without them, and the accessibility area says what is
  missing where it matters, with an Install button on the card.
  Later, `python -m courseforge tools` reports the same thing,
  `python -m courseforge tools --install --yes` does the install, and
  `python -m courseforge tools --ask-again` brings the first-run offer back.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/billathekilla737/CourseForge-Studio
cd CourseForge-Studio
pip install -e .[pdf]
```

Copy the example config (only `base_url` needs changing if you are not at MGCCC):

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

On Windows PowerShell: `Copy-Item config.example.json config.json`

Your Canvas token does **not** go in that file. Start the app and it will show a
**Connect to Canvas** button; paste the token there. It is checked against
Canvas, then stored encrypted under your user profile
(`%APPDATA%\CourseForge-Studio\canvas.token.enc`, readable only by your Windows
account on this machine). A token saved by the old canvas-grader or CourseForge
tools is found and migrated the first time you save.

Check everything:

```bash
python -m courseforge doctor
```

To prove the whole thing works without touching a live course, work through
[docs/TEST-PLAN.md](docs/TEST-PLAN.md): preflight commands, a safety check
that nothing writes without a confirmation, and a numbered walk through every
area with what each step should show.

## Running it

**Windows, no terminal:** double-click **`CourseForge Studio.vbs`**. A small
window says it is running, with a button that opens the app in your browser.
Closing that window stops the server and any Claude work in flight.

**From a terminal:**

```bash
python -m courseforge serve      # http://127.0.0.1:8900
```

Run it from a normal terminal, not from inside a Claude Code session, so the
Claude CLI can see your login.

## From the command line

Every area's verbs are also commands, which is what the Assistant runs:

```bash
python -m courseforge a11y dump --course 734391
python -m courseforge a11y restyle --course 734391 --look clean
python -m courseforge a11y verify --course 734391
python -m courseforge a11y push --course 734391            # dry run
python -m courseforge a11y push --course 734391 --apply    # asks for a typed yes
python -m courseforge pdf fix --course 734391
python -m courseforge course due-dates --course 734391
python -m courseforge record --course 734391 --verify
python -m courseforge students show --course 734391 --who Student-14
python -m courseforge --help
```

A verb that writes to Canvas does nothing without `--apply`, and prints the plan either way.

## Configuration

`config.json` keys are documented inline in
[config.example.json](config.example.json). The ones people change:

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `base_url` | `https://mgccc.instructure.com` | Your Canvas host |
| `model` | `opus` | Grading model (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`) |
| `describe_model` | `sonnet` | Alt text and image descriptions |
| `a11y_look` | `clean` | Restyle look; `clean` scores zero advisory flags in Ally |
| `pdf_jobs` | `0` | PDF engine worker processes; 0 = CPU count minus 2 |
| `assistant_ask_timeout_s` | `1200` | An unanswered Allow/Deny is a Deny after this long |
| `allow_canvas_writes` | `true` | Hard read-only lock when `false` |
| `pseudonymize` | `true` | Swap student names for tags before anything reaches a model |
| `audit_to_canvas` | `true` | Keep the record of actions in your own Canvas user files |
| `llm_backend` | `cli` | `api` switches to an API key (hosted build; see below) |

`CANVAS_TOKEN`, `CANVAS_BASE_URL` and `CANVAS_GRADER_PORT` override the file.

## Hosting it for a school

The local build uses your Claude Code login and stores work on your machine. A
school-hosted build swaps in an API key, Postgres, single sign-on and a worker
queue behind the same code. The design, the data model, the security controls
and a phased rollout are in [docs/DEPLOYMENT-SCHOOL.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT-SCHOOL.md).
