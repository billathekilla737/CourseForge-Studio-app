"""An account of what was done, kept where it cannot quietly be edited.

The ledger next door answers "what did I change in this course lately". This
answers a different and much less comfortable question: a year from now,
somebody disputes whether a student's approved accommodation was actually
given, and the college has to show that it was. The ledger cannot carry that.
It names pages and files rather than people, it lives in a folder on one
laptop, and nothing about it says whether a line was added after the fact.

So this is a second record, with three properties the ledger does not have.

**It names people where naming them is the point.** An entry about an
accommodation says which student, by Canvas id and by name, what was set, on
which quiz, and whether Canvas accepted it. That is student data, and it goes
exactly one place: Canvas, where the same student's grades already are. It is
never sent to a model -- the Assistant's tags are in `identity.py` and the
grader's are in `pseudonym.py`, and neither of those reads this file.

**It is tamper-evident.** Each entry carries the hash of the one before it, so
the file is a chain. Editing a sentence, deleting a row or slipping one in
later breaks every hash after it, and `verify` says which entry it broke at.
This is not the same as tamper-proof. Anyone who can write the file can
rewrite the whole chain from that point. What it does mean is that a quiet
edit is not possible: the whole tail has to be rebuilt, and Canvas has its own
timestamp on the copy it holds.

**It leaves the machine.** Each month's file is uploaded to the instructor's
own Canvas user files, which no course copy, term rollover or sandbox cleanup
touches. Canvas stamps it with a modified date nobody here controls. So the
record of what was done in Canvas lives in Canvas, and a laptop being replaced
does not take the evidence with it.

What it is not: a substitute for Canvas's own logs, and not a legal document.
It is a contemporaneous record made by the tool that did the work.
