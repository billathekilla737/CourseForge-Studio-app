"""Letter grades and grade curves.

Two rules hold everywhere in this module, and the rest of the tool depends on
them:

1. **A curve never lowers a score.** Every kind is clamped so a student's curved
   score is at least what they earned. A "curve" that took points away from
   someone would be a grade change with no audit trail and no conversation, and
   the instructor almost never means it: they set a target mean below the current
   one by accident, or typed a negative boost. The plan reports how many students
   a curve would have lowered so the mistake is visible instead of silent.

2. **The earned score is never overwritten.** A curve is stored beside the scores
   as a set of deltas, so the original is always recoverable, the adjustment is
   always visible, and removing a curve is exact rather than approximate.
