"""Keep the local draft and the Canvas gradebook in step without losing work.

Two machines, one gradebook. A grade pushed from the home PC should be waiting
on the work PC the next time it looks, and a grade half-finished on the work PC
must never be overwritten by that look. So every entry remembers the score Canvas
held the last time this machine and Canvas agreed (``synced_score``), and a pull
is a three-way compare against that baseline:

    local == canvas                    in step: refresh the baseline
    local == baseline, canvas moved    the other machine graded it: take Canvas
    canvas == baseline, local moved    unpushed work here: keep it, say nothing
    both moved, or no baseline yet     conflict: record both sides, change nothing

Comparing against a baseline rather than against clocks means two machines with
drifting clocks, or a grade typed straight into the Canvas gradebook, still
resolve correctly. Nothing in this module writes to Canvas; the only writes are
to draft.json and extracted.json.
