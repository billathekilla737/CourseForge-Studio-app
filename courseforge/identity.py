"""Type a student's name; Anthropic sees a tag.

The grader already pseudonymises the work it sends for marking. The Assistant
did not, because the Assistant is free text: you type "why is Jordan Alvarez
failing" and every word of that goes to a model running on somebody else's
computer. Which meant the honest answer to "can I ask it about a student?" was
no.

This is the bridge. A course gets one stable map -- `Student-1`, `Student-2`,
in Canvas user-id order -- kept in `data/<course>/names.json` and never
uploaded anywhere. Outbound, every way of writing a student's name is swapped
for their tag. Inbound, the tags in Claude's reply are turned back into names
before the page draws them, so the conversation reads normally at both ends
and the roster stays on this machine.

What it does not do, said plainly because the UI says it too:

  * It only knows this course's roster. A name that is not on it is not a name
    as far as this module is concerned, and goes out as typed.
  * It covers what you type and what comes back. It cannot cover a file the
    model reads: if you let the Assistant open the gradebook, real names go
    with it. That is what the Allow card is for.
  * A surname two students share is refused rather than guessed. Guessing
    would either send a real name or attribute the question to the wrong
    person, and both are worse than a question.
