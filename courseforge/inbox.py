"""The Canvas Inbox: what students asked, what it means, and a drafted reply.

Three things happen here and they are worth keeping apart.

**Reading** is a Canvas call on the grading-scoped client, because
`/conversations` is student data and `canvas_policy` refuses it to everything
else. Nothing is marked read: somebody skimming this screen has not answered
anybody, and clearing the unread flag on their behalf would take away the only
mark they had.

**Thinking** happens with the names taken out. A student's message goes to
Claude as `Student-14 wrote`, and the body is scrubbed of names, emails, ids
and phone numbers first -- including the names of other students they mention,
which is the case a per-message swap would miss. Claude answers in tags. The
tags become names again on the way to the screen and on the way into the reply,
so what the student eventually reads says their name and what Anthropic saw
never did.

**Sending** is the instructor's, always. A draft sits in a box until somebody
presses Send on that specific reply, and that press goes through the same
confirm gate as every other Canvas write: refused once, shown as a sentence,
sent on the second pass. There is no rule engine and no unattended send. A
message to a student under somebody's own name is the least reversible thing
this tool can do, and the one place where "it seemed right at the time" is not
a defence anybody wants to make to a dean.

SYSTEM = """You are helping a college instructor answer their Canvas Inbox.

Students reach you as tags: Student-14, Student-3. You never see a real name
and must never invent one; write the tag if you need to refer to someone.

Answer with JSON and nothing else:
{"asking": "...", "kind": "...", "urgency": "routine|soon|today",
 "needs_you": true|false, "why": "...", "reply": "..."}

- "asking" is one sentence: what this student actually wants.
- "kind" is a short label: deadline, grade question, rubric, technical, absence,
  accommodation, thanks, other.
- "needs_you" is true when answering needs a judgement only the instructor can
  make -- anything about a grade, an accommodation, a late penalty, a personal
  circumstance, or anything you would be guessing at.
- "reply" is a draft the instructor can send as written: their voice, two or
  three sentences, no greeting beyond the student's tag, no sign-off, no
  promises about grades or extensions, and no invented facts about the course.
  If you do not know something, say what you would need rather than filling it
  in. When needs_you is true, draft the part you can and leave the decision to
  them in plain words.

When the instructor has given a direction, that direction decides what the
reply should do. It is not the reply. Never copy the direction into "reply",
and do not answer with their note lightly reworded. Write the short message
the student will read, in the instructor's voice, that carries out the
direction. If they said there is no extension, the reply tells the student
that, in a sentence a student can understand. If the direction cannot be
squared with what the student asked, follow the direction and say what the
mismatch is in "why" rather than quietly splitting the difference. When a
direction is present and it already decides the question, "needs_you" is false."""
