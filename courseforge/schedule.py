"""A term-wide schedule of every dated assignment, with what is waiting to grade.

Shaping and classification only: fetching lives in server.App, and the grouping
into weeks happens in the browser.

**Weeks are grouped client-side on purpose.** Canvas returns due dates in UTC,
and a due date of 04:59Z is 11:59 PM the *previous* day in Central. Grouping
those into weeks server-side would file a Sunday-night deadline under the wrong
week, which is exactly the mistake this view exists to prevent. The browser knows
its own timezone, so it does the bucketing.

**Type is read from the name, not from Canvas's own fields.** In real courses
`is_quiz_assignment` is False for "Unit 1 Test" (delivered through an external
tool) and True for "Test: Chapter 8 - Proctored Exam", so those fields say how an
item is delivered rather than what it is. The name is what the instructor and the
students actually go by.
