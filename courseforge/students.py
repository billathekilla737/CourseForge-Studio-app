"""What the Studio knows about a student, with the student taken out of it.

The Assistant could not answer a question about a student, and the reason was
sound: it holds a Canvas client that `canvas_policy` refuses student endpoints
to, so a prompt injected into a course page can never turn into a read of the
gradebook. That guard is worth keeping.

But "it cannot reach Canvas's student endpoints" and "it cannot help you think
about a student" are different sentences, and only the first one had to be
true. Everything below is assembled here, on this machine, out of work the
Studio has already done -- the grading drafts, the accommodation list, the
record of what was pushed -- and handed over with the names removed. Claude
sees `Student-14` and a set of numbers. It never sees a roster, and no Canvas
request is made at all.

Two rules hold, and `assert_clean` enforces the second one rather than trusting
the first:

  * only a tag identifies a student here, in and out;
  * no real name, email, login or SIS id may appear anywhere in the payload,
    including inside free text somebody else wrote.

The second matters because rationales and comments are prose. They were
written from pseudonymised input, so they should already be clean, and they are
scrubbed again on the way out because "should already be" is not a property you
can rely on a year from now.
