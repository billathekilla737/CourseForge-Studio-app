"""Cheap guards on the files the browser loads.

There is no JavaScript test runner here and adding one for six files would cost
more than it saves, so this pins the two things that have actually gone wrong
while editing them with tools rather than by hand: a stray control byte written
into the source, and a backslash lost out of a string that becomes a regular
expression.

Neither is caught by reading the diff. Both break the page silently.
